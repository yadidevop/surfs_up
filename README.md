# SurfsUp Analysis: Temperature Trends


## Project Overview

#### The purpose of this analysis is to show prospective investor of a surf and ice cream shop, W. Avy, the temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii for the month of June and December. W. Avy would like to use this analysis to determine if the surf and ice cream shop he is planning to invest in, is a sustainable business year-round. <p>&nbsp;</p>

#### The tables above show us weather patterns for the month of June and December.

1. Both June and December have similar average temperatures. The average June temperature is 74 degrees, while December is 71 degrees.

2. The max temperature for months is also very similar. June is 85 degrees, while December is 83 degrees. 

3. The minimum temperature for December shows the biggest difference from the month of June. The minimum temperature for December is 56 degrees, while June is 64 degrees.<p>&nbsp;</p> 

## Summary

Overall, according to the data provided, June and December have similar temperature variations, except for the minimum temperature in December. This could imply that the temperature remains somewhat constant throughout  the year. It is recommended that further analysis be done, specifically in the monthly precipitation, since that's a factor that could affect the sales. A closer look at the daily temperatures should also take place. The standard deviation implies that there may be some temperature outliers that may need to be removed to more accurately predict the weather patterns.
